# AWS_SecurityRecommendations

In my last week of a 12 week re/Start course, I put together this Security Recommendation document/portfolio to suggest solutions 
to a new customer who is looking to move their business over to AWS. They run a smallish online retail site that specializes in 
selling handmade cruelty free skin care products. They ship globally, and while they are based in France, they do have audiences 
across the globe. They want to start expanding into new markets but current on premises infrastructure is limited. 
As they grow they anticipate more security needs, up until now this was all managed by their networking manager who just left. 
My dream is to one day be an AWS Solutions Architect, and this is the first of many proposal documents!
